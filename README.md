# Adding food items

Supported food items use the following format:

    {
        "name": "Tomato",
        "reflux": "avoid",
        "category": "Fruits and vegetables"
    }

* **name** - plaintext name of the food item, include serving max in brackets
* **reflux** - reflux classification of the item. Currently only "avoid", "remedy" and "ok" are supported
* **category** - food category this item belongs to

Notes:

* If you are new to JSON, please note that all food items except the last item must have a comma after the closing }
